Desc of Asmt: We were tasked with tasked with creating a Data Structure of our choosing from
  an available list, of course some code of a Single Linked List from our teacher to help construct 
  ours. I constructed a queue for my Data Structure along with the proper methods to fulfill the 
  criteria for a fully functioning Queue
